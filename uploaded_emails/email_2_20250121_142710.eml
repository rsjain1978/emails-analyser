Subject: Update on Sherilee's Health Issues

Hi Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and provide you with an update on Sherilee's health issues, as I know you are concerned and have been asking about her lately.  

Unfortunately, her condition has not improved as we had hoped. The doctors have been running several tests to figure out the root cause of her symptoms, including persistent fatigue and occasional dizziness. We're still waiting on some results, but it looks like they might want to refer her to a specialist to get a clearer picture.  

Sherilee is trying her best to stay positive, but it’s been tough on her mentally and physically. She appreciates all the support you’ve given her during this time. If you have time, I think she would love a visit or even just a chat over the phone.  

Let me know if you're available to connect with her.  

Best,  
James
