Subject: Concern Regarding Email Security Incident

Dear HR Team,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally report a concerning incident that recently came to my attention. It seems that one of our employees, Mark Thompson from the finance department, has been sending sensitive company information to his personal email address.  

I observed this while reviewing the logs during a routine security check. The details that were transferred include confidential financial reports and client data, which could potentially pose a security risk for our company.  

Given the nature of this sensitive information, I believe it is crucial for us to address this situation promptly to ensure that our data security protocols are being upheld. Please let me know how you would like to proceed and if any further information is required from my side.  

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  

Best regards,  
John Smith  
IT Security Officer  
Company XYZ
