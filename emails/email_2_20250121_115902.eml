Rest assured, all information will be handled with the utmost confidentiality and used solely for the purposes of this project. If you could provide these details at your earliest convenience, it would greatly assist us in moving forward effectively.

Thank you for your cooperation. Please let me know if you have any concerns or need clarification on any points.
