Subject: Incident Report: Company Data Sent to Personal Email

Hi HR Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report a concerning incident involving sensitive company information. It has come to my attention that one of our employees, Alex Johnson from the marketing department, has been sending sensitive details, including client lists and project plans, to their personal email account.

I noticed this while reviewing some documents and checking compliance with our data handling practices. It raises several security concerns, as this information could be easily accessed or misused.

I believe it is crucial that we address this situation promptly to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of our company data. Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this matter or if you need any additional information from my end.

Thank you for your attention to this serious issue.

Best regards,
